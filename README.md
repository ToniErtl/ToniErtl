👋 Hi, I’m @ToniErtl, a Research Assistant at ELTE KRTK, and a PostDoc at Universiy of Iceland.
My research topics are experimental and behavioral economics, while I also study housing economics.

I am primarily an R user, occasionally using Python and Stata as well. I use these for statistical analysis and machine learning solutions.

You can reach me at antal.ertl@krtk.elte.hu
