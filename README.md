- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ToniErtl, a PhD. Student of Economics at Corvinus University of Budapest, and a statistician at the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.
My research topic includes experimental economics and decision theory, while I also study housing economics.

I am primarily an R user, however I am also interested in Python. I use both for statistical analysis and machine learning solutions.
